# *BookQuest*
BookQuest is a dynamic and interactive website built using `ReactJS`, designed to showcase my personal portfolio and love for books. This project utilizes `Google's Book API` to provide a vast collection of books that users can search, view summaries, previews, and reviews. It serves as a one-stop platform for visitors to explore my favorite books, read brief summaries, and even purchase them through external links.

## Features:

- **`Book Search`**: Users can search for books using various parameters like title, author, ISBN, etc.
- **`Book Summary`**: Detailed summaries of each book are displayed to give users an insight into the content.
- **`Book Preview`**: Where available, users can view book previews to get a glimpse of the book's contents.
- **`Book Reviews`**: Users can read reviews for books they have read to share their thoughts.
- **`Buy Book`**: The website includes external links to reputable online stores where users can purchase the books they are interested in.

This project is an excellent demonstration of my web development skills, particularly in ReactJS, API integration, and UI/UX design. It also reflects my passion for literature, making it a unique and engaging portfolio piece.

Feel free to explore the website and discover some amazing reads while getting to know me better!
