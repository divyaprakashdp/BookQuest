# _BIBLIAI_

BIBLIAI is a dynamic and interactive website built using `ReactJS`, designed to showcase my personal portfolio and love for books. This project utilizes `Google's Book API` to provide a vast collection of books that users can search, view summaries, previews, and reviews. It serves as a one-stop platform for visitors to explore books, read brief summaries, and even purchase them through external links.
